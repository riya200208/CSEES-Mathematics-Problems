we got 
array a : No.of candy in each ith jar
array b : cost of each candy in the ith jar

Total cost array [ai*bi]
we need to divide this cost for each ith jar in such a way we need the to use minimum cost tags
COST ARRAY : [ a1*b1 , a2*b2, .....,an*bn]

i want to find the common divisior of costs 
Then that will help to group the jars those are possible to
if that gcd is divisible by lcm of costs of each candy then that grouping is possible only

why gcd%lcm?

because we are using gcd as cost for each packet of candy and that cost should be a multiple of cost of each cnady.
