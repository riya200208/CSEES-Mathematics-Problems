Here the numbers can be formed like this

1 number -> 2 same primes 
[ because they will have 1 prime factor itself only and 1 more composite factor multiplication of them ] 
1 number -> 3 different primes
[ 3 different prime factors them only and multiplication of them atleast  3 composite factors ] 

so calculate the frequency of prime divisors for each number then 
traverse through those frequencies 
->if odd [ increase counter]
->add frequency/2 to your answer

end loop 

add counter/3 to the answer
