    here 
    case 1: a is minimum
            then x = b, y = b or a, z =a
            so we need two large elements to be equal 
    case 2: b is minm
            then x = a, y = c and z = a or c
            so we need two large elements to be equal 
    case 3: c is minm
            then x = a or b , y = b, z = a
            so we need two large elements to be equal 
            
    Hence to get an answer we require two large elements to be equal 
    As you can print them in any order so
    print 1 , minm of a,b,c  and maxm of a,b,c
